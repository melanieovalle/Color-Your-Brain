# Color-Your-Brain
Color Your Brain - AP CSP Create Performance Task 2022

Color Your Brain is a fun and challenging game designed to trick your mind!

At the start, players choose between two languages—English or Spanish—to play the game in their preferred language. The game rules will be displayed in the selected language, and once you're ready, you can click to begin.

The game consists of six levels, each featuring a color name displayed in a different color. Your task is to identify and click the box that matches the color described by the word, not the color the word is written in. It’s a brain-bending exercise that tests your focus and mental flexibility!

This game was created by three students from the AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course. Have fun and see if you can master the challenge!
